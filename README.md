As TED lovers, we are interested in improving TED's service; therefore, in this project, we aim to provide some recommendations for TED not only to provide better user experiences to its users but also to augment the influence of these awesome videos.

We plan to dig into our data to find the factors that contribute to the number of views because we believe the number of views is a signal of how influential a video is. Moreover, we intend to provide some concepts of the service that can be applied on TED website to improve the user experience.

We have prepared three datasets for our analysis. The first two datasets were downloaded from Kaggle, containing information about all audio-video recordings of TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017 (2464 records in total). Dataset 1 contains information about all talks including number of views, number of comments, descriptions, speakers and titles. Dataset 2 contains the transcripts for all talks available on TED.com. Dataset 3 was scrapped from the Wikidata website, containing information about the speakers of TED talks like gender, birthday and description.
